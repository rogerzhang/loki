- need to integrate the automated process into a CI / build process like Jenkins

- generally, integration point for localization vendor can be source control repository, containing the XLIFF files for all projects

- interesting analyses
	- the following metrics would be interesting
		- resource strings that contain inline style attributes
			- total count
			- total count of inline style attributes
			- as a percentage of the strings
			- as a percentage of the overall string size
			- as a percentage of the total word count

- localization projects
	- master project, sub-projects
	- potentially hierarchical
	- ability to define project base class and subclasses
	- need to address mutiple concurrent branches of same project
		- release branch with patches
		- development branch for next release
